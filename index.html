    <div id="aboutContent">
<p>I am a Creative Technologist, Filmmaker, and Educator interested in making innovative and exciting projects that make tech and art more accessible, inclusive, and ethical. I strive to do this by working collaboratively to create projects that benefit different communities and enact change. I have a focus on web development and physical computing.</p>
<p>I work to combine film and technology to create critiques of how we navigate and use the web today. Within my film work I have been interested in how we can construct narratives using computer interfaces and the boundaries we can push within that. Within web design I have been combining film, creative coding, machine learning, and AI to create dialogues around consent and ethics online. </p>
<p>Outside of my art based practice I am an educator and strive to make learning code more accessible and fun for people of all ages. I am often working on lesson plans and gathering resources online to help support the growth of young coders. I feel passionate about making learning to code an easy and creative experience instead of intimidating. </p>
